Welcome to my site! I am current a third year master student in [NUAA](https://www.nuaa.edu.cn/) (Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics) advised by [Prof. Cong Peng](http://cae.nuaa.edu.cn/2018/0906/c13664a132202/page.htm) and [Prof. Yangang Wang](https://www.yangangwang.com). My research interests are mainly on 3D Computer Vision, including 3D Reconstruction, Point Cloud Learning, etc. 

In my spare time, I love playing soccer and basketball. I am a devoted supporter of Chelsea club, we are blues! Also I am second Dan in Kendo.
